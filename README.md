This proyect has been developed by a group of four people for the PROP subject at the Informatics Faculty of Barcelona. 
The objective of the project was to simulate supermarket with different products, which have different sinergies between eachother, 
it had to provide various distributions for a number of shells and products selected. The way this was done is by implementing different
algorithms, from which the user can choose, two of them are aproximation algorithms (Hill Climbing and Simmulated Annealing) 
and the last is just a simple brute force algorithm. Asides from the mentioned, the proyect also has some other functionalities
like the mannagement of the different products and their sinergies. For more information look at the user manual.

Note: something not mentioned in the manual is that there are some shortcuts added in the program, for instance, if the user
wants to press a button which label starts with any letter, the user can press Ctrl + <letter>
in order to activate the button desired
